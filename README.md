# Salary Predictions Based on Job Descriptions

The purpose of this project is to make accurate salary preditctions that are based on existing known salaries so the company is able to recruit and retain top talent. This model will help the company for offering competetive pay to existing and future employees while also keeping payroll expenses in check.

Data transformation and machine learning will be used to create a model that will predict a salary when given years of experience, job type, college degree, college major, industry, and miles from a metropolis.

The data for this model is relatively simplified as it has very few missing areas. The raw data consists of a dataset with the features listed above and their corresponding salaries. Twenty percent of this dataset was split into a test dataset with corresponding salaries so accuracy and error of the model can be determined.

The features in this data set are described as below:

Years Experience: How many years of experience 

Job Type: The position held (CEO, CFO, CTO, Vice President, Manager, Janitor, and senior or junior position)

College Degree: Doctoral, Masters, Bachelors, High School, or None

College Major: Biology, Business, Chemistry, Computer Science, Engineering, Literature, Math, Physics, or None

Industry: Auto, Education, Finance, Health, Oil, Service, or Web

Miles From Metropolis: How many miles away from a major city
